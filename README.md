# ElmitecReadUviewFileFormat
Import Uview files in Python

This class (readUview) can be used to read uview file formats (.dat).

See testReadUview.py to see how to use it.

Important note:
Copy the file readUview in the directory of your script. This way you can import it as a module: "import readUview as ru".
If you want to keep things clean, I can package readUview, so that you don't have to copy it around. Let me know.

Please send any comments, bugs or requests to me. Feel free to join/improve the python code.
